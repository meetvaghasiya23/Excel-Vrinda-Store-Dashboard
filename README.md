# Vrinda Store Data Analysis

Business Problem: In order to better understand its customers and boost sales in 2023, Vrinda Store intends to create an annual sales report for 2022.




## Steps

1) **Data Cleaning**: In order to clean up the data, we utilise Excel's "Find and Replace" feature together with the Filters to check for duplicate entries and null values.

---------
2) **Data Processing**: We process information that will aid in our analysis. We also need to know the gender-age connection, but that will be a laborious effort at certain ages. Thus, we categorise people of different ages.
-----
IF the age>=50 => "Senior"
IF the age>=30 => "Adult"
Else "Teenager"

- Additionally, we need the month for our study, so we utilise Excel's =TEXT() method to extract the month from our Date column.

3) **Data Analysis**: We created Pivot tables and charts and some of the insights extracted are:

- "March" is the month with the most orders and sales.
- In the year 2022, women made more purchases than men.
- The different order status are:
    - Delivered - 92%
    - Refunded - 2%
    - Returned - 3%
    - Cancelled - 3%

Hence, most of the orders are Delivered.
- The top 5 states contributing to the sales are: Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu
- Adult Women has the highest number of orders
- Amazon is the most dominant channel

### Conclusion 
#### To improve their sales, Vrinda Store can:
  - Target female consumers in the 30-to 49-year-old age range living in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh by showing ads/offers/coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra.
